# NotoeAI
Local-first AI home assistant with a FastAPI backend and Next.js frontend

NotoeAI is a local-first, privacy-focused AI home assistant with a FastAPI backend and a Next.js frontend.

It’s designed to run on your own hardware, stay on your local network, and give you full control over your data and models.

# What it is

Local AI home assistant with a FastAPI backend and Next.js frontend.

FastAPI backend (API + assistant core)
- Uses Ollama for local AI inference
- Model-agnostic architecture
- Privacy-focused (runs locally)

Next.js frontend (web interface)

Extensible architecture

# Privacy Promise

NotoeAI is designed to run locally and never transmit user data off-device by default.

- No telemetry or analytics
- No external API calls unless explicitly configured by the user
- No user data should ever be committed to this repository

**Any deviation from this principle must be clearly documented and opt-in.**

# Status

🚧 Early development / experimental
Interfaces and architecture are still evolving.
